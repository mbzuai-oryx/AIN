## üìñ Overview
<p style="text-align: justify">
AIN, the <b>Arabic Inclusive Multimodal Model</b>, bridges the gap in generative AI for Arabic by leveraging Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) data to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks and specialized domains. AIN is a <b>bilingual model</b> (MSA and English) with broad applications from <b>medical</b> to <b>agricultural</b> domains, excelling in <b>OCR and Document Understanding</b>, and <b>Remote Sensing Imaging</b>. Trained on <b>3.6M </b>samples, where <b>35%</b> of its Arabic data comes from authentic sources. Built on Qwen-2-VL, AIN empowers Arabic speakers with advanced, inclusive AI capabilities, outperforming leading models in key benchmarks. </p>

## üßê Data Verification and Toxicity Filtering
A multi-step verification pipeline was implemented to ensure high-quality translations and safe visual data. Translation accuracy was assessed through human evaluation, where native Arabic speakers rated outputs against reference translations, and semantic similarity checks were conducted using **LaBSE**. Additionally, translated samples were reverse-translated and validated using **BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE scores** to measure correctness, correlation, and overlap. For visual data, toxicity filtering was applied using **LLavaGuard‚Äôs safety policies and GPT-4o**, identifying and removing unsafe content related to violence, substance abuse, and harmful imagery, ensuring compliance with ethical AI standards.
